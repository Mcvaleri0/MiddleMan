# MiddleMan

This was part of my thesis and was supposed to be the bridge between Alexa and the app Chronicles of Crime.
It was developed using Unity3D to prototype easily.

MiddleMan was used to prove that the communication between the smart-assistant Alexa and an exterior app is possible, proving that is possible to use the assistant to play the board game Chronicles of Crime.
